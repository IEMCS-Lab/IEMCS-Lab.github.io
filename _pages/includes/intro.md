# ⭐About Me and IEMCS-Lab

I work at **Beihang University** as an **Associate Professor** now in Beijing, China. Our group is focused on **Intelligent Electromagnetic Computing and Sensing (IEMCS)**. Here is the photo of all members (2025) in our IEMCS-Lab:

IEMCS-Lab's and my research interests lie in computational electromagnetics, particularly AI-based computational electromagnetics and the application of deep learning in fast and intelligent electromagnetic modeling and inversion imaging algorithms. This includes electromagnetic simulation of aircraft, large-scale parallel computing, array antenna optimization, electromagnetic inverse scattering imaging, and biomedical imaging.


I am currently a master's supervisor, recruiting 1–2 master's students each year. If you are interested in joining our team, please email me at [taoshan@buaa.edu.cn](mailto:taoshan@buaa.edu.cn).
